Version : v1p3                          (Date : July 27, 2014)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Release Notes :
1. All file names are modified as per the customer request(prifix with csi2tx)
2. The file csi2tx_sensor_iface.v is modified to take care of the
   delay in the external interface between the pixel_header_accept de-assertion
   to packet_data_valid assertion
3. Regressions are simulated with NCSIM version 10.20-s114

Release Notes :
1. This is Gold Release of CSI-2 Transmitter with 8 data Lane and 1 clock lane
2. The modification in the Design
   a) register_iface.v 
      - AHB Out of address range error is updated(AHB slave address range 32'h00 to 32'h6c).
3. The modification in the verification Environment
   a) Assertion module (csi_tx_assertion.sv)is added for protocol checking. 
   b) The decoder (csi_decoder_bfm.v) is added for the compression scheme
   d) 11 testcases are added to improve the code coverage.
4. The script(sim.csh) is updated to enable coverage metrics.
    -New files(coverage_merge_vlog.csh,imc_verilog.do) are added to generate coverage report.
    -please refer readme.txt for coverage report generation procedure.
5. The release package includes the coverage reports and wavier list in the reports directory.
6. CSI2_Transmitter_Testplan.xls is updated for the newly added testcases.
7. The release package includes 209 test cases. 
  - Additional testcases are added for the coverage and compression scheme.
  - These testcases can be tested for different lane/frequency through script.(Refer Readme.txt)
8. RTL code is updated/fixed for the internal BUGs
9. Regressions are simulated with NCSIM version 10.20-s114
